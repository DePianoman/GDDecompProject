# CappuccinoSDK + MinHook + CMake template
Hi most of this (especially the `CMakeLists.txt`) was proudly stolen from [kyurime/robtop-bot](https://github.com/kyurime/robtop-bot)

## Usage
clone the repo and change the project name (`template-project`) in CMakeLists.txt

## Building
idk i just press a button and vscode does it for me
